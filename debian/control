Description: JS+SVG library for drawing railroad syntax diagrams, like on JSON.org
 Railroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar in a form
 that is more readable than using regular expressions or BNF. They can
 easily represent any context-free grammar, and some more powerful
 grammars.
